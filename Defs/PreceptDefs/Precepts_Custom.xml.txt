        <!-- Trait to apply
        
             Replace TRAIT_NAME with the trait added to female pawns.

             Only one trait is supported and this has to be the internal rimworld defName for 
             that trait
             
             If you're unsure what the defName is, poke around the other XML files here or open
             your rimworld install folder (google it), then go to Data -> Core -> Defs -> TraitDefs
             and look at the xml files there.  Find the trait you want, and there'll be a 
             <defName>TRAIT_NAME</defName> near it.  If thats in Traits_Spectrum.xml, then you'll
             also need to know the <degree>.../degree> setting for below.
             
             If this is only removing traits and not applying any, remove the line entirely
             -->

        <!-- EDIT THE LINE BELOW THIS, DELETE IF NOT NEEDED -->
        <trait>TRAIT_NAME</trait>

        <!-- The degree for spectrum traits

             If the trait being applied is a standard trait, leave this at 0

             Traits like chemical fascination, chemical interest and teetotaler are the same 
             'DrugDesire' trait, but with a degree number applied to separate them.

             The degree can be found in the Rimworld TraitDefs, see above

        <!-- Traits to remove
        
             Replace TRAIT_NAME with a trait to remove when converting pawns

             Supports removing multiple traits: each trait should be on its own line surrounded 
             by <li>...</li> tags 
             
             If this isn't removing traits, remove the <li>...</li> line entirely
             -->

        <!-- Traits that conflict

             Replace TRAIT_NAME with a trait that conflicts when converting

             Supports multiple traits: each trait should be on its own line surrounded
             by <li>...</li> tags

             If a pawn has a trait in the list they will not be given the new trait when
             they're converted or have any traits removed.  Its intended as a balance
             mechanic and should normally follow the vanilla Rimworld trait conflicts

             If a trait conflict isn't listed here but is detected during gameplay 
             (e.g. a precept to force transhumanist onto body purist without body
             purist listed as a conflict here), trait enforcer will presume its intentional
             and *remove all traits that conflict* so the new trait can be safely applied.
